/*

This class supports two kinds of clipboard: the regular Windows-style
clipboard, and the X selection.  The X selection is a special text-only
clipboard that is set when the user highlights text in an edit control
without explicitly pressing CTRL+C.  The clipboard usage rules are
documented at freedesktop.org, and may be summarised as follows:

- When the user highlights a piece of text, set the X selection, but
  do not alter the Windows clipboard.
- When the user hits CTRL+C to copy, then set the Windows clipboard,
  but do not alter the X selection.
- When the user hits the middle mouse button, then paste the contents
  of the X selection at the current cursor position, but do not paste
  the contents of the Windows clipboard.
- When the user hits CTRL+V to paste, then paste the contents of the
  Windows clipboard, but do not paste the contents of the X selection.
- If the user removes the highlight, then do not set the X selection
  to empty - leave it as-is.
- The "Copy" and "Paste" menu options are considered equivalent to
  CTRL+C and CTRL+V respectively.  "Cut" is handled in the same way
  as "Copy" where clipboard operations are concerned.

Deviating from these rules in any way will cause X users to get confused.
Where the above rules differ from freedesktop.org's, then freedesktop.org's
rules will be considered the correct ones.
