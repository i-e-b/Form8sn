PdfSharpStd
===========

PdfSharpStd is a fork of PdfSharp that doesn't require a Windows operating system. It will open, edit and create PDF files from any .Net Standard 2.0 platform.
Some graphics features of PdfSharp's rendering to screen are not fully supported, due to using PortableGdi.
All PDF operations are supported.

PDFsharp is a .NET library for creating and modifying Adobe PDF documents programmatically from any .NET language like C# or VB.NET.
PDFsharp defines classes for the objects found in PDF files, so you never have to deal with IDs or references directly.

PDFsharp creates and processes PDF documents on the fly from any .NET language.
The same drawing routines can be used to create PDF documents, draw on the screen, or send output to any printer.
